I wanted to make some tests with paper folding to show how laser cutting can create 3 dimensionality for paper.

These works are redrawn, reinterpreted from works of Eric Gjerde, Yoshinobu Miyamoto and Ron Resch.

I think we can make a small workshop with paper folding.

Here are some links I have found useful to understand how they work:
