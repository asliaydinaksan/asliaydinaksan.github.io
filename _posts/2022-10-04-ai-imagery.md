Yesterday, we had a conversation with Henk about creating images in AI software.

Prompting a software to create images requires knowledge in various areas. Firstly, a level of knowledge on art and art history is elemental. Then, understanding of the AI software to guide a succession of prompts to reach certain levels of complexity is also crucial. Lastly, you need to have a motive for creating such imagery. If not with knowledge, you might be creating aesthetically appealing images out of pure _intuition_. At the end, they all point to having your own signature in the software. Hence, I certainly believe that AI imagery is art.

Here are a few links related to this subject.

**[Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/)**: you need a paid membership after 40 images.

**[DALLÂ·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/)**

**[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/)**: free software

**[Phraser](https://phraser.tech/)**: helps you create text prompts for the AI software.

**[Have I Been Trained](https://haveibeentrained.com/)**: upload your images and see if your images have been used to train AI softwares.
