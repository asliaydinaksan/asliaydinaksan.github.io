**Tool: Sense**

**Software: 3D Systems Sense**

The 3D scanner we have at the Fablab is Sense 1 from 3D Systems. You will need the software 3D Systems Sense to accompany the scanner. The Software and the user guide can be found on their [website](https://support.3dsystems.com/s/article/Sense-Scanner?language=en_US).

In this post, I will explain the steps to scan a head (my head).

Plug Sense to your computer via USB-port.

Open the Sense software.

Go to **SCAN SETTINGS > HEAD**

Press **SCAN**

While scanning, check your computer screen. Green overlay on the model indicates the scanning is going fine, continue; red overlay indicates the scanner lost reference, so go back to a point which the scanner can recognize and continue from there.

When the scan is finished, press **PAUSE** and then **FINISH**

Rotate and check the model. You can adjust your model with **TRIM** and **ERASE**

Once you are satisfied with the model, Press **SOLIDIFY**. Solidify creates a 3d printable model.

Press **FINISH** when you are done and **SAVE** your file for future use.

**EXPORT** your model as **.obj** file. This is the file you will use, if you want to 3D Print your model as well.
