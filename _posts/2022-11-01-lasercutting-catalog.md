We have a lasercutting Maker Skills Course coming on the 4th of November. I wanted make some samples of things that can be achieved with lasercutting.

First set of samples shows how material behavior change with cutting through the material.

Same cuts give different bendability for different materials and thicknesses.

Second set of samples demonstrates 3 different approaches to a 3 dimensional object.



Stacked slices, radial slices, folded panels
