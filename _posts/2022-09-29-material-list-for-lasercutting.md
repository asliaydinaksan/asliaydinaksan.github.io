| Acrylic/Lucite/Plexiglas/PMMA | |
| Thin Polycarbonate Sheeting (<1mm) | Watch for smoking/burning |
| Coroplast ('corrugated plastic') | |
| HDPE | Low melting point, watch for melting and fire |
| Delrin (POM) (thin) | |
| Kapton tape (Polyimide) | |
| Mylar | Gold coated mylar will not work |
| Solid Styrene | Keep it thin |
