Every intern designs and mills a personal box at the FABLAB. The boxes serve two purposes: to learn how to design and mill a box with tolerances and joinery; to have a container to store personal items at the lab.

I designed my box in Rhinoceros with the following considerations in mind:

- I wanted a sliding lid to easily access the box contents. Sliding lid allows for one-handed use as well as easily closing the box back.

- I wanted hollowed out pockets for handles, which makes the box easy to carry.

- I wanted a raised bottom to keep the contents safe as much as possible in case there was liquid leakage around the box.

- I wanted press fit parts so that I would not need wood glue or nails to put the box together.
