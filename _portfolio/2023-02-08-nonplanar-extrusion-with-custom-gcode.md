The project challanges the planar slicing in many market available slicers for 3d printers such as Cura, Prusa Slicer. Similar to [Variable Extrusion with Custom G-code project](https://asliaydinaksan.github.io/portfolio/2022-12-15-variable-extrusion-with-custom-gcode/), the experimental vessel was designed in Rhinoceros and Grasshopper. The gcode was generated directly inside Grasshopper. Unlike the Variable Extrusion, two consecutive points on the vessel are not coplanar with reference to XY-plane, hence the extruder moves up and down while extruding. This project has its limitations beacuse the extruder head is wide and does not allow for big movements on z-axis and PINDA sensor adds another obstacle that limits movement.
