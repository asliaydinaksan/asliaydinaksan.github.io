Fablab Amsterdam hosted the Fablab Instructors Bootcamp 2023 in January. After the Bootcamp, I designed an information board to remember what the instructors worked on during the bootcamp.

The central longitudinal piece was designed during the bootcamp and fine-tuned by me afterwards for better performance and aesthetical improvement. The information panels were designed in Illustrator, printed in a common printer, cut around the edges with a Cricut Maker 3 and pasted on lasercut repurposed cardboards.

The Beehive axes design on the right bottom corner was one of the ongoing research by one of the instructors. I 3D printed one sample (I had to remodel the long axes to fit the bearings at the lab). I also designed a press-fit base for the axes which can exhibit the axes with an angle and can be taken out for closer inspection.
